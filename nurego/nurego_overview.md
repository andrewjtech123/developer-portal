## Introduction to Nurego

Nurego provides you with total control of your subscription business, presenting a complete picture of business operations in a single place. By displaying key SaaS metrics such as ARPU, Churn, and Revenue, in a simple and user-friendly manner, Nurego offers a powerful change management tool for your subscriber base.

### Subscriber segmentation:

Nurego gives you the power to fine tune your company's subscription plans by segmenting subscribers. Managing segments gives you the ability to optimize your company's business by adjusting price plans and trying out new products on a per-segment basis. This enables trial-runs and incremental rollouts of business changes, to optimize results and avoid negative impacts to the existing subscriber base.

### Live and Test Mode

Each Nurego account includes both a live and test instance. Your test instance enables you to conduct a complete test cycle for an entire backend system (customer website, billing, communications and deployment) without negatively impacting your existing customer base.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";

print s

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
